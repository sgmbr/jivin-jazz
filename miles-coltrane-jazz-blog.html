                    <h3>Vijay Iyer Trio @ Miller Theater, Columbia University, NYC 22-Oct-2016</h3>
                    <p class="post-date">30 October, 2016</p>
                    <img src="images/vijayIyertrio.jpg" alt="Vijay Iyer Trio" class="blog-lead-img">
                    <p>It's probably best to be forthright about this: while I have read all of the reviews of pianist Vijay Iyer's releases on the Free Jazz Blog, and enjoyed the profile on him in the New Yorker before his appearances at the opening of the Met Breuer, aside from the Trio 3 + Vijay Iyer recording Wiring (Intakt) from 2013, I really knew Iyer's music best by text. However, a chance to see him with bassist Stephan Crump and percussionist Tyshawn Sorey (both of whom I have had the pleasure to hear many times) at Miller Theater, Columbia University, was a great opportunity to rectify this. I approached with an open mind - armed with only the pile of descriptions - and left a satisfied customer.</p>
                    <p>The show was broken into two 40 minute sets (or so, I didn't actually keep track) and each one had its own personality. The first was an unbroken string of tunes, until the last song, where the band paused, Iyer bantered a bit, and launched into a final song (possibly a Radiohead tune?). Two other covers, or rather deconstructions, in this set were 'Work' by Thelonious Monk and 'Human Nature' from Michael Jackson. While I have it on good authority that the latter is a concert staple, what the trio does with it was fantastic. Distilling key musical events - like the well-known chorus - and using it as a bridge between solos and collective workouts, the original song became a touchstone in a maelstrom. It was ever a pleasure to hear Sorey kicking the shit out of his kit!</p>
                    <p>Overall the first set seemed to really mine Iyer's catalog, and the songs had the ECM 'sound' to them - atmosphere and spaciousness were the rule, but one which was often broken by the rapturous climaxes of interlocking layers powered by Iyer's elliptical arpeggiated bursts. Crump's crisp bass lines, which hung just behind Iyer's beat, gave the music additional oomph, as did Sorey's imaginative drumming.</p>
                    <p>The musical statements in the second set seemed to flow more continuously and the connection between the three musicians involved even deeper concentration. On one tune, a pastoral 'mid-western dreamscape' à la Pat Metheny, Crump was noticeably deep in thought, conjuring the bass by shaping the air around it. When he finally connected with the instrument, the song  - which I had found a touch sleepy - suddenly burst apart is his hands as he played a solo that completely changed the group's direction. Sorey and Iyer responded in kind and the peak they reached was a tornado ripping though the musical landscape. That tune, along with Sorey's crescendoing solo on the penultimate tune, received enthusiastic applause from the already receptive and excited audience.</p>
                    <p>An excellent show, and one that has me scrambling to back-fill my collection!</p>

                    <h3>Kris Davis / Craig Taborn @ Roulette, NYC 2-Oct-2016</h3>
                    <p class="post-date">9 October, 2016</p>
                    <img src="images/kris-davis-craig-taborn.jpg" alt="Kris Davis and Craig Taborn" class="blog-lead-img">
                    <p>Pianists Kris Davis and Craig Taborn’s first night of a two-week tour in support of Davis’ new release Duopoly (review coming soon) at Brooklyn's lovely Roulette was preempted by a critical piano tuning. Against the austere stage backdrop, the two concert grand Steinway’s on the theater’s stage were impressive, and the time taken to ensure proper intonation was certainly forgivable, but when the duo appeared, expectations were high. </p>
                    <p>Davis pressed the first key and the show had begun. The song unfolded slowly, whole notes delivered at a ballad tempo. The tension between the suspended chords filled the space between them. Taborn seemed to almost strike the keys, at first playing the silence. Then, fingers darting about the keyboard, his strikes became bolder and more frequent, until a melodic phrase shot out, was caught by Davis, and returned. The tempo picked up and Davis began delivering stabbing chord tones in quick rhythmic jabs. Taborn filled in the spaces between, until they began to move in an akimbo lockstep. The second piece started in an uplifting manner, two interweaving melodies connecting in tonal clusters, somewhat Taylor-esque, percussive, aggressive, but always musical and never without purpose. Davis held down the song's evolving structure while Taborn injected shots of energy into the syncopated, pulse driven logic. </p>
                    <p>At first, it was a bit unclear if the two were reading off musical scores - not that it mattered at all, however, it looked like Davis was, but less clear if Taborn was, as his papers were scattered across the top of the piano. However, in a short banter between songs, as David pulled a roll of duct tape out of a bag and began preparing the insides of her piano, Taborn introduced the concert as one in support of the new Duopoly recording, but where they were playing all new compositions from Davis. Mystery solved. In these compositions, jazz, classical, avant-garde and whatever other categories I am not naming, played together, oblivious to their roots but never betraying them.</p>
                    <p>Davis seems to be on a roll, and her new compositions, apparently unnamed at this point, seamlessly juxtapose dissonance and angularity with classicism and beauty - at times it felt like a cubist painting unfolding in sound. The compostions are getting bigger, but at the same time, she’s pared down the instrumentation (her last release, Save Your Breath, featured an octet). However, two pianos offer a lot of musical possibilities and this was thoroughly exploring with an assuredness that was refreshing and enjoyable. </p>
                    <p>Yes, after the long opening act of the piano tuner, expectation were high, but they were more than met.</p>
                    <p>Catch David and Taborn on the West Coast and in PA this coming week, and check out Duopoly, a series of compositions and free improvisations with an impressive roster, including Taborn, Bill Frisell, Tim Berne and many others. (Available at the Downtown Music Gallery).</p>

                    <h3>Shibusashirazu Orchestra - Prato, Italy 3-Jul-2016</h3>
                    <p class="post-date">8 July, 2016</p>
                    <img src="images/shibusashirazu.jpg" alt="Shibusashirazu Orchestra" class="blog-lead-img">
                    <p>Shibusashirazu is the quintessential “live” ensemble. Founded in Tokyo in 1989 by bassist Daisuke Fuwa, the band consists of a variable number of rotating musicians, usually around twenty, plus dancers and various performers. The Orchestra’s activity is well documented on a series of CDs and DVDs, and even if the music is still very enjoyable on its own, it’s the live dimension that really amplifies the impact and originality of this project. Scenography has a very important role, with textiles, costumes, video projections, live painting and flying inflatable creatures being an integral part of their shows. </p>
                    <p>Last Sunday in Prato, in a beautiful square in front of the medieval town castle, they presented a typical performance, with all the above ingredients in full display, and maybe to those who knew them from records or videos there weren’t many surprises in the overall structure or in the compositions played – but seeing them live has proved to be a surprising, electrifying experience.</p>
                    <p>Firmly grounded in the tradition of the most original free jazz large bands (not too far in spirit from the Sun Ra Arkestra), musically they covered much ground, from blues and funk to balkan tinged numbers, from mildly saccharine j-pop ballads to straight-ahead rock anthems. The spirit was unequivocally that of free jazz though, with a chaotic, frenetic activity on stage, and the solos, especially from the woodwinds, were usually loud, furious excursions often verging on noise. The instrumental quality of the ensemble was impeccable, and Fuwa conducted it with exquisite aplomb and a taste for tight exchanges and infectious grooves, often dividing the ensemble in various instrumental combinations, giving space to the soloists yet never forgetting the full big band sound and orchestral capabilities of the group.</p>
                    <p>Music was only a part of the show though, and one of the most fascinating aspects was the role of the dancers and performers that populated the stage. Along the half-naked singer and master of ceremonies, there were three Butoh dancers painted white from head to toes, two girls in kimonos waving oversized plastic bananas in unison, another blonde dancer in a bra and skirt adorned with flowers, plus a samurai-style performer that mimicked karate moves and a young girl in a sheep costume. And then the final touch: a giant inflatable silver dragon the appeared mid-show from the back of the stage and traversed the packed square, flying over the audience heads.</p>
                    <p>Sounds crazy? It was. But all these often contrasting, apparently absurd elements fit perfectly into the show, combining with the music for a total immersion in a surreal world of sound and visuals, a rarely seen performance dimension that humorously underlined the most peculiar, omnivorous aspects of Japanese culture.</p>
                    <p>Shibusashirazu – that incidentally means something along the lines of "never be cool" – is a rare combination of artistic integrity and audience friendliness, offering a truly unique sensorial experience, a powerful, joyous celebration of creativity and spontaneous expression.</p>
