# web-practice

I made this website for a website development course project.
In the project I've experienced a whole cycle of website development, from
an interview for the client, to making specification, designing pages and
implementing them.

The project is for an imaginary client, Miles Coltrane, who is a collector of
live jazz recordings, and his company Jivin' Jazz, to share his collection.
Each student was assigned to a musician, in my case it was Patt Metheny (yay).

The website was made from scratch to deepen my understanding in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

Responsive
Made it responsive by using CSS media queries. The point is not using popular
device dimensions to determine breakpoints because the device landscape is
always changing. Respect users' preference of font size and use "em"s to design
everything, not pixels.

Minimalist design
