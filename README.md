I made this website for a website development course project.
In the project I've experienced a whole cycle of website development, from
an interview for the client, to making specification, designing pages and
implementing them.

The project is for an imaginary client, Miles Coltrane, who is a collector of
live jazz recordings, and his company Jivin' Jazz, to share his collection.
Each student was assigned to a musician, in my case it was Patt Metheny (yay).

The website was made from scratch to deepen my understanding in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

// As it was made for a school project, there were copyrighted texts, which I
replaced to Lorem Ipsum.
